    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>

    <p>In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statments.</p>

    <p>JavaScript program is a list of programming statements. Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statments. The statments are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are writte.</p>
    <p>JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called <b>JavaScript code</b>.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript Statments</h2>
    <p>In HTML, JavaScript statments are executed by the browser.</p>
    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <h2>Semicolons</h2>
    <p>Semicolons at the end of each executable statement;</p>
    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <p>When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:</p>
    <p id="demo4"></p>

    <h2>JavaScript White Space</h2>
    <p>JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.</p>
    <p> var person = "Hedge";  is easier to read than  var person="Hedge"; </p>
    <p>A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):</p>
    <p>var x = y + z;</p>

    <h2>JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks</h2>
    <p>For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.</p>
    <p>If a JavaScript statment does not fit on one line, the best place to break is after an operator.</p>
    <p id="demo5"></p>

    <h2>JavaSCript Code Blocks</h2>
    <p>JavaSCript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.</p>
    <p>The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.</p>
    <p>One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:</p>
    
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>
    <p id="demo6"></p>
    <p id="demo7"></p>


    <h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
    <p>JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.</p>
    <p>JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.</p>
    <p>Below is a table with some keywords:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Keyword</th>
